Project Title: Automobile Showcase Website

Description: The Automobile Showcase Website is a dynamic and user-friendly platform designed to provide users with a seamless experience for browsing and exploring automobiles. The website features a secure login system to ensure user privacy and restrict access to authorized users only.

Once logged in, users can access the "Browse Cars" page, which showcases a curated collection of vehicles displayed in a visually appealing 3x2 grid layout. The design includes a consistent background theme, offering an immersive and cohesive browsing experience. The project emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and an intuitive user interface to make it accessible to all users.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with future plans to integrate database functionality for enhanced features like saving user preferences, managing car inventories, and adding interactive elements.

This project demonstrates skills in web development, frontend design, and client-side scripting, serving as a foundation for more advanced systems in the future.
